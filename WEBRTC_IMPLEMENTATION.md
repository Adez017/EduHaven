# WebRTC Video Session Implementation

This document explains the WebRTC video session implementation and the fixes applied to resolve stability issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Audio/Video Control Issues
**Problem**: Audio was still being transmitted even when microphone was muted.
**Solution**: 
- Fixed `UseMediaHandlers.jsx` to properly respect toggle states
- Implemented proper track enabling/disabling logic
- Only request media streams for enabled features

### 2. Multi-User Video Sharing
**Problem**: Only one video was being shared when multiple users joined.
**Solution**:
- Replaced deprecated `addStream` API with modern `addTrack`
- Fixed stream management in `WebRTCConnection.jsx`
- Improved peer connection handling for multiple participants

### 3. Video Card Visibility
**Problem**: User video cards sometimes weren't visible.
**Solution**:
- Enhanced `VideoConferenceView.jsx` with proper grid layout
- Added better user identification and stream management
- Improved connection state monitoring

### 4. System Stability with Multiple Users
**Problem**: System became unstable with more than 2 participants.
**Solution**:
- Added connection state monitoring in peer connections
- Improved error handling and cleanup when users leave
- Enhanced signaling logic for better coordination

## Technical Implementation

### Modern WebRTC APIs
```javascript
// OLD (deprecated)
connections[id].addStream(stream);
connections[id].onaddstream = (event) => { ... };

// NEW (modern)
stream.getTracks().forEach(track => {
  connections[id].addTrack(track, stream);
});
connections[id].ontrack = (event) => { ... };
```

### Media Track Management
```javascript
// Proper audio/video toggle handling
if (videoToggle || audioToggle) {
  const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ 
    video: videoToggle, 
    audio: audioToggle 
  });
  // Add appropriate tracks based on actual state
}
```

### Connection State Monitoring
```javascript
connections[socketId].onconnectionstatechange = () => {
  const state = connections[socketId].connectionState;
  if (state === 'failed' || state === 'disconnected') {
    // Clean up failed connections
  }
};
```

## File Structure

```
Client/src/hooks/WebRTC/
├── WebRTCConnection.jsx    # Core peer connection management
├── UseMediaHandlers.jsx    # Media stream handling and controls
├── UseSocketService.jsx    # Socket.IO signaling integration
└── VideoConferenceView.jsx # Video display component
```

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:
- ✅ Single user audio/video controls
- ✅ Multi-user connectivity (2+ users)
- ✅ Chat functionality
- ✅ Connection stability
- ✅ Proper cleanup on user disconnect

## Setup for Development

1. **Server**: 
   ```bash
   cd Server && npm install && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Client**: 
   ```bash
   cd Client && npm install && npm run dev
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Client: Create `.env` with `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000`
   - Server: Create `.env` with basic configuration (see `.env.example`)

4. **Test URL**: `http://localhost:5173/session/test-room`

## Architecture Notes

While the goal was to implement SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit), the current implementation maintains the P2P mesh architecture but with significant stability improvements. For a true SFU implementation, consider:

- Server-side media relay (using mediasoup, kurento, or janus)
- TURN server setup for NAT traversal
- Bandwidth optimization and codec negotiation
- More complex signaling for track management

The current improvements make the mesh architecture much more stable and suitable for small group sessions (2-5 participants).
